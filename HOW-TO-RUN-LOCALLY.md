# üöÄ How to Run Your Portfolio Website Locally

## üéØ Quick Start (Recommended)

### Method 1: Using Python (Easiest)
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/portfolio

# For Python 3.x (most common)
python -m http.server 8000

# For Python 2.x (if you have older Python)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Method 2: Using Node.js
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/portfolio

# Start the server
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Method 3: Using PHP
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/portfolio

# Start PHP server
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

## üìÅ Project Structure

Your portfolio folder should look like this:
```
portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main website file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css              # All styling and animations

- Update project demo links if you have live versions

### 4. Add Real Blog Posts (Optional)
- Update the blog section with your actual blog posts
- Add real links to your blog articles

## üåê Alternative Methods

### Using Live Server (VS Code Extension)

## üéØ Testing Your Website

### Local Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Website loads without errors
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Animations play smoothly
- [ ] Contact form shows notifications

- [ ] Tablet view

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Website doesn't load
- **Problem**: CORS errors or file not found
- **Solution**: Use a local server instead of opening HTML directly

#### 2. Images don't show
- **Problem**: Incorrect file paths or missing images
- **Solution**: Ensure `profile-photo.jpg` exists or placeholder will show

#### 3. Animations don't work
- **Problem**: JavaScript errors or missing files
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors

#### 4. Styling looks broken
- **Problem**: CSS file not loading
- **Solution**: Ensure `styles.css` is in the same directory as `index.html`

#### 5. External fonts/icons don't load
- **Problem**: No internet connection
- **Solution**: Ensure you have internet access for CDN resources

## üì± Mobile Testing

To test on mobile devices:
1. Start your local server
2. Find your computer's IP address
3. On your phone, go to: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000`

### Finding Your IP Address:
- **Windows**: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
- **Mac/Linux**: `ifconfig` in Terminal

## üé® Performance Tips

### For Best Performance:
- Optimize images before adding them
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Minify CSS and JavaScript for production
- Enable gzip compression on your server

### For Development:
- Use browser dev tools to debug
- Test on different screen sizes
- Check console for any errors

## üîí Security Notes

- This is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS only)
- No server-side code or database required
- Safe to host on any static hosting service
- Contact form is client-side only (for demo purposes)

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Ensure all files are in the correct location
3. Try a different browser
4. Check your internet connection
5. Verify local server is running

## üéâ Success!

Once everything is working:
- Your portfolio will be live at `http://localhost:8000`
- All animations and interactions will work smoothly
- You can share your local IP address for others to view
- Ready for deployment to any hosting service
